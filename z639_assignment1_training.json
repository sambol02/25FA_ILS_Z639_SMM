{"text": "> If you start your \"state\" by forcibly moving 700k people \n\nYou have some really logical points there, but you start off by this propaganda fueled lie and I really suggest you to learn past what your local Muslim Free Palestine group at your college campus has taught you.\n\nThe truth is that the vast amount of Arabs moved on their own, their leaders have called for them to leave as they believed their neighbors will come to help them, real quote: \"Annihilate the Jews\" and then to return. Young Israel did not have any capabilities of doing such a thing much less so in the midst of a war with about 7 invading armies. That is completely ridiculous.\n\nI am not saying nothing bad happened, things sure did as they always do in a total war (Started by the Arab world, important to mention). But the vast majority of these people have fled or fought (And lost).\n\nOn the contrary, the Palestinians who decided to stay on the designated borders of Israel and declared their peaceful intentions, got fair rights and today make over 20% of Israelis.\n\nWhich is exactly why the apartheid claims are so silly. When over 20% of Israelis ARE Palestinians enjoying completely equal rights including political parties (One was a part of the last coalition for example), supreme court judges, work with us, study with us, etc...\n\nWatch this very short old historical doco bit: https://twitter.com/YosephHaddad/status/1604345764439785472\n\nNow, tell me, do you know what happened to Jewish communities in the West Bank after the UN partition plan?

If you start your \"state\" by forcibly moving 700k people and preventing them from returning--- then have a military occupation over where they got crammed  (sure they pulled out of Gaza eventually) and economic blockade and no right to self-govern --- I mean there's something to be debated at the very least.  It's not the very same thing than what happened in South Africa, clearly, but parallels were drawn.\n\nI am also not saying that the Palestinian Islamists in power aren't hostile.  They are.  And the problem is that because they feel pressured they  keep turning to complete dickheads to represent them which isn't helping their cause.  If Israel pulls out of Palestine it'll be like USA pulling out of Afghanistan with the Taliban taking over and just driving the country in a shithole.\n\nAnd Palestinian refugees in other Arab countries apparently are treated even worse, even if those were the countries that technically backed them.  Like in Egypt where they were never really helped or given citizenship either.  So it's not like those pro-Palestine neighboring countries are doing anything to help either other than dunk on Israel\n\nIt's just one big great shitpie.  The ideal scenario would be to let Palestinians have their own nation and not be occupied and for Israel to be left alone peacefully but I don't know how that's going to happen with the current forces in power.  Perhaps if they managed to elect some leaders that weren't Islamists but people tend to turn to religious fundamentalist and nationalist views when they're under duress.  \n\n\nI'm centrist and not Jewish so I don't really have a horse in the race, just my observations here.", "article_title": "Gaza: Sixth militant commander killed in Israeli air strike", "article_url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65571023", "platform": "reddit", "platform_id": "jjwcu6k", "composite_toxic": [[false, 121], [false, 95], [true, 261], [true, 99], [true, 112]]}

This would be the craziest shit ever if it isn\u2019t CGI. Show me the evidence of CGI though, I\u2019m not married to this TikToker. We all want a better understanding of truth. \n\nI am just stating what we know - and not what a lot of folks like to pretend to know better.

There\u2019s all kinds of science we\u2019re just scratching dealing with electromagnetic fields and quantum mechanics. That kind of tech with fields, polarization, and all this stuff I know zero about - we do know can cause weird effects on cameras and sensors. We can imagine this advanced stuff (and still undiscovered stuff) might be utilized by a more technologically advanced \u201cother\u201d. \n\nI just can\u2019t believe people pretend to know everything when there\u2019s clearly not a consensus reality on this subject. Hence, fascination by millions paying attention\u2026 and minor annoyance at those who get off being the smart and logical know-it-all kids in the playground.

{"text": "The truth is there is no *birth right citizenship* for the children of immigrants, illegal or not, nor for visitors to this country.  The left always ignores the specific part of the 14th Amendment that states\n\n>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, **and subject to the jurisdiction thereof**, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nThe law was written to ensure children of freed slaves were citizens.  As the slaves had no home land they were fully **subject to the jurisdiction** of the United States.  Immigrants and visitors are not, they are all citizens of their respective home countries and subject to their jurisdiction.\n\nThe left, as usual, likes to play games and claim that the phrase applies to everyone in our borders because they're all required to obey our laws, so that makes them *subject to the jurisdiction** but that is crap.   Everywhere you go in the world you are required to obey local laws.   Here's a practical example.\n\nThe United States today taxes the income of US citizens who live and work overseas, they are all required to file tax returns.  Many other nations do the same thing.\n\nNow, an immigrant (legal or illegal) working in the United States is also required to file tax returns in the US if they earned an income.  That is no different than a person living in Florida having to file tax returns in New York if they did business there.   \n\nBut if that same immigrant leaves the US, goes to another country or goes back to their home country, because they are not truly *subject to the jurisdiction* of the US, the US can **not** tax them any longer.  This is exactly why 14th specifically did not apply to the *Indians non-taxed* who actually lived inside the US borders, they were considered *subject to the jurisdiction* of their tribal nation.  Congress had to pass legislation many years later to grant them citizenship upon birth.  No such legislation exists regarding existing non-citizens (legal or illegal).  No child born in the US who doesn't have at least one biological parent that is already a US citizen becomes a US citizen due to birth.\n\nSo where the article says \n\n>Trump said. \"From all over the world they came. Under Biden's current policies even though these millions of illegal border crosses have entered the country unlawfully, **all of their future children will become automatic U.S. citizens**. Can you imagine?\n\nTrump is playing into the left's game by accepting the lie as the truth.

In fact, how far do we have to look ahead to see the Hercules airframes aging out? (this isn't rhetorical, I'd genuinely like to know) because if they get too old, they'll stop being one of the most reliable airframes in the fleet and turn into a 35 tonne albatross that needs a constant supply of expensive spares and life extensions.   \nMy point is, they will need replacing at some point, so why not do it now when they can be sold rather than scrapped, and there's plenty of time to get used to its replacement? Yes, there are some shortfalls, but even though I'm not military or a pilot, I reckon it's probably easier to bodge a plane so you can drop a RHIB out the back than it is to find another 17 tonnes of cargo capacity and 20 years of service life on an airframe.", "article_title": "UK will be left 'dangerously exposed' when it cuts fleet of special forces aircraft, sources say", "article_url": "https://news.sky.com/story/uk-will-be-left-dangerously-exposed-when-it-cuts-fleet-of-special-forces-aircraft-sources-say-12881389", "platform": "reddit", "platform_id": "jk95xw1", "composite_toxic": [[false, 120], [false, 52], [false, 136], [false, 152], [false, 1057]]}

This seems supported by the widely known fact that NATO can't even continue to provide 155mm artillery shells in the numbers needed, weapons which are presumably far easier to produce.

I don't believe it's legal or acceptable for regional Arab and Turkish Islamists or the minority liberal faction or Western liberals in North America and Europe to support an insurgency and attempted takeover of another foreign sovereign country by proxy just because they want to spread their ideology abroad by the sword and believe they will be able to gain geopolitical advantage by doing so (that they will be able to puppetize it if they can get people they support to seize control). \n\nThis against a country which didn't attack any of them, wasn't about to or attempting to, and didn't even threaten to. To me, that's therefore a war of aggression, the supreme crime by the Nuremberg standards from which all subsequent resulting crimes derive.\n\nBut I'm a fervent supporter of and believer in the Westphalian system of state sovereignty. For full disclosure, I was staunchly against any attempts to topple the Syrian government ever since March of 2011, but if a domestic faction actually managed to do so of their own accord with zero foreign backing, then that's ultimately an internal affair.

The case is also considered among the weakest of the cases that the DA could have brought, and most consider it unlikely to lead to any substantial punishment even if he's found guilty on all counts, largely because nobody wants to deal with the logistical and political nightmare that would come with attempting to jail a former President.  \n\n* Merrick Garland has been shown to be afraid of his own shadow.  There is absolutely no reason to believe he intends to file charges in the foreseeable future, and Jack Smith doesn't exactly have his foot on the gas either.  \n\n* Georgia just passed a law allowing Kemp to remove prosecutors from office for whatever reason he sees fit.  All indications are that this bill was passed as a direct result of Fani Willis and her investigation into Trump's election interference, and any attempt at actually charging Trump with a crime will lead to her removal by Kemp and the investigation subsequently squashed.  \n\nAnd even if you're still optimistic enough to believe that Trump will eventually see some form of punishment, remember:\n\n* He's been out of office for 2.5 years now, and has still not seen any punishment for his decades of crimes.\n* Despite being charged with over 30 felonies, he was not handcuffed.  He was not perp-walked.  No mugshot was taken.  He was able to negotiate the terms of his own arrest and surrender.  \n* Despite being charged with over 30 felonies, he's still allowed to travel around the world in his own private jet unimpeded.  \n\nKnow of any other accused criminals that get that kind of treatment?", "article_title": "Disney expands lawsuit against DeSantis after governor signs bill to void land deals", "article_url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/disney-lawsuit-against-desantis-expanded.html", "platform": "reddit", "platform_id": "jjejkjx", "composite_toxic": [[false, 201], [false, 122], [true, 275], [false, 240], [false, 69]]}

{"text": "#####&#009;\n\n######&#009;\n\n####&#009;\n\n> # [How Erdogan\u2019s reelection will shift Turkey's foreign policy goals](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/628)\n> \n>   \n>   \n> Having won Sunday\u2019s runoff vote, Turkish President [Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/us-braces-another-erdogan-era-turkey) will extend his rule into a third decade with piles of foreign policy issues on his plate. The strategy that won him reelection and his desire to build a legacy will both require Erdogan to sustain and nurture the notion of a \u201cstrong Turkey\u201d in foreign policy.\n> \n> Normalization with Syria is the thorniest dossier, calling for drastic decisions. The return of the Syrian refugees \u2014 either forcibly or voluntarily \u2014 was a top issue on the campaign trails. Any progress there depends on not only reconciliation with Damascus but also the provision of living spaces to the returnees. A Turkish-Syrian deal alone cannot smooth the way for reconstruction. US and European objections will have to be overcome as well.\n> \n> Earlier this month, Turkey and Syria agreed to continue dialogue toward normalization at a [four-way meeting in Moscow](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/first-turkey-syria-fm-meeting-russia-agrees-work-refugees-terrorism) involving Russia and Iran. Nevertheless, Damascus maintains that the withdrawal of Turkish forces from Syria is a precondition for any meeting between the two countries\u2019 leaders.\n> \n> **No immediate withdrawal from Syria**\n> \n> Erdogan is unlikely to go for a withdrawal without crushing the de facto autonomous administration in the north led by Kurdish groups that Ankara sees as terrorists. He built his election coalition around the pledge of resolutely fighting terrorism and remains reliant on his nationalist partners to command the majority in parliament.\n> \n> Also, Erdogan is unlikely to acquiesce to dissolving the Syrian National Army, an umbrella group of Turkish-backed rebel groups, or changing the status quo in Idlib, where the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham holds sway, until he gets what he wants at the negotiating table.\n> \n> While US support for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) remains an irritant in ties with Washington, Ankara now has to reckon with another important factor: The Arab world has begun to rebuild ties with Damascus and is seeking to end Turkey\u2019s military presence and curb Iran\u2019s influence in Syria. Having readmitted Syria earlier this month, the Arab League tacitly denounced Turkey and Iran in its May 19 joint statement, rejecting \u201cforeign interferences\u201d and \u201csupport for \u2026 armed groups and militias\u201d in Arab countries.\n> \n> The Arab reengagement with Damascus could strengthen the latter\u2019s hand in normalization talks with Ankara. Kurdish sources told Al-Monitor that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been encouraging Damascus \u2014 with tacit US approval \u2014 to integrate the SDF into the Syrian army as part of efforts to push back Iranian influence. Such moves clash with Ankara\u2019s interests as well.\n> \n> Erdogan, some observers believe, will seek to cast himself as an above-party national leader akin to Turkey\u2019s founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in what is expected to be the final stage of his political career. Such aspirations would require him to embrace diversity at home, but he could also pursue ventures nurturing the notion of a \u201cstrong Turkey\u201d to build that image.\n> \n> The strategies that Erdogan pursued to consolidate his electoral alliance rested on the narrative of a \u201cstrong Turkey\u201d that has fought terrorism far and wide, developed its military industry including armed drones, manufactured its first electric car, discovered energy resources in its Black Sea waters, increased its power in the eastern Mediterranean, become a playmaker in the Caucasus by helping Azerbaijan reclaim territories from Armenia, led the creation of the Organization of Turkic States, stood up to NATO and the European Union to defend its interests, put Greece in its place and mediated between Russia and the West in the Ukraine war to prove its strategic autonomy. By flattering national pride, fanning national security fears and villainizing his opponents, Erdogan was able to avoid paying a price for Turkey\u2019s economic turmoil, his government\u2019s shoddy response to the February earthquakes and rampant allegations of corruption. This playbook dictates that the nationalism and triumphalism permeating his foreign policy should continue.\n> \n> Erdogan\u2019s quest to institutionalize his authoritarian shift was met with a popular objection that sent the presidential vote into a runoff but is unlikely to push him back to the democratic path. Any decision to heed rulings by the European Court of Human Rights and release scores of political prisoners would come as a huge surprise.\n> \n> **EU membership a distant prospect**\n> \n> Reviving Turkey\u2019s membership talks with the European Union appears a distant prospect, too, for it would require the miracle of Erdogan reinstating check and balances, the rule of law and democratic norms. Still, Turkey\u2019s worsening economic outlook, marked by an alarming foreign-currency crunch, requires continued partnership with the European Union. The flow of foreign portfolio investments to Turkey has all but stalled amid Erdogan\u2019s controversial economic policies, with the central bank\u2019s international reserves deep in negative territory.\n> \n> Erdogan\u2019s pragmatism dictates that Turkey makes the best of its position within NATO and partnership with the European Union. Having gained in spades from his double game between Russia and the West, Erdogan is unlikely to part with that policy. Moreover, he would not like to upset Russian President Vladimir Putin given the latter\u2019s [economic gestures](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/turkey-elections-currency-fears-grow-ahead-presidential-runoff) ahead of the elections, including the postponement of Turkish gas payments. Putin gave Erdogan further political credit on May 17 when he agreed to extend the Ukraine grain deal that the Turkish leader had mediated. Economic interests \u2014 chief among them Turkey\u2019s Russian-built nuclear power plant and the gas and grain trade \u2014 will continue to drive bilateral ties in addition to continuing dialogue on Syria and Ukraine.\n> \n> Tensions with NATO ally Greece and the Greek Cypriots are unlikely to go away, given the importance that Erdogan places on the energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean.\n> \n> But despite Ankara\u2019s frequent rows with Western partners, those anticipating a rupture between Turkey and NATO have yet to prove justified. Having approved Finland\u2019s accession to NATO in March, Ankara could well unblock the way for Sweden as well at the NATO summit in July. Yet, getting rid of the Russian S-400 air defense systems appears impossible for Ankara as long as its relationship with Moscow remains strategic.\n> \n> **Closer ties with China?**\n> \n> During his third term as president, Erdogan could dedicate a stronger effort to realizing the so-called Zangezur Corridor plan \u2014 a transport route that would connect Azerbaijani territories via Armenia and provide Turkey with a direct link to Azerbaijan proper \u2014 in a bid to solidify Turkey\u2019s role in the Caucasus, gain access to the Caspian Sea and strengthen ties with the Turkic states in Central Asia. It would require normalization with Armenia, managing tensions with Iran and keeping up the dialogue with Russia.\n> \n> As for China, Erdogan has largely stepped back from criticizing Beijing\u2019s treatment of the Uyghur community and raised the prospect of Turkey joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organization led by Russia and China. Despite Beijing\u2019s wariness, he could press on for closer ties with the East.\n> \n> As former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza put it recently to The New Arab, Turkey\u2019s bridging role between West and East would continue but Ankara\u2019s focus could now shift to \u201cbeing anchored in the East and willing to hold the West, meaning Europe and the US, more at arm\u2019s length.\u201d\n\n  \n  \n  \n- - - - - -\n\n[Maintainer](https://www.reddit.com/user/urielsalis) | [Creator](https://www.reddit.com/user/subtepass) | [Source Code](https://github.com/urielsalis/empleadoEstatalBot)", "parent_comment": null, "article_title": "How Erdogan\u2019s reelection will shift Turkey's foreign policy goals", "article_url": "https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/05/how-erdogans-reelection-will-shift-turkeys-foreign-policy-goals", "platform": "reddit", "platform_id": "jm38dbv", "composite_toxic": [[false, 232], [false, 23], [false, 317], [false, 189], [false, 260]]}

As is standard, the warrant allowed the agents to force Raymond to use his finger to unlock the phone. But courts have held that law enforcement can\u2019t force a target to give up his passcode, because that would violate the Constitution\u2019s Fifth Amendment ban against forced self-incrimination.\n\n> Agents took the phones from Raymond after meeting him in the lobby of his hotel, but he had turned them off before handing them over. Accessing them at that point required the passcode, which the agents did not have. They went back to the hotel an hour later after consulting with a Justice Department prosecutor and told Raymond he was compelled to use his thumbprint to open the phones. But the agents failed to keep the phones from locking, so they went back a third time at the prosecutor\u2019s urging, and Raymond provided his passcodes, allowing them to change the settings so they could continue to access them, court records show.\n\nJust seems like a few moving parts:\n\n* Are warrants even required for searches of government-issued phones?\n* I'm struggling to follow whether this means that the agents got the defendant to unlock the phone with his fingerprint. It's not clear from the reporting, only that it was unlocked at some point but that the agents neglected to keep the phone from timing out.\n* I imagine a lot will depend on the specific facts, not necessarily reported here by NBC.\n* What's the good faith exception say when there *was* a valid warrant for the stuff on the device but that the warrant was executed in a sloppy, noncompliant way?\n\nInteresting stuff.

We found all the tools that they used (in mummification) in ancient times,\" Waziri said.\n\nBoth workshops featured stone beds, clay pots, ritual vessels, natron salt, which is one of the main ingredients for mummification, and linens among other mummification instruments.\n\nThe Saqqara excavations also led to the unearthing of two small 4,400 and 3,400-year-old tombs nearby, belonging to two priests, Ne Hesut Ba of the Old Kingdom's fifth dynasty and Men Kheber of the late kingdom's 18th dynasty respectively.\n\nInscriptions of cultivation, hunting and other daily activities were found on the walls of Ne Hesut Ba's tomb while \"scenes showing the deceased in different positions\" were engraved in Men Kheber's tomb, officials said.\n\nEgypt has carried out extensive digging operations in Saqqara and other ancient locations in recent years, which resulted in a number of high-profile discoveries.\n\nThe country plans to inaugurate the Grand Egyptian Museum, a state-of-the-art facility near the Giza Pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo, after construction is completed later this year.\n\nEgypt hopes it can further lure back tourists after the industry started to rebound of late, having been battered by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nTourism revenues climbed to $7.3 billion in the second half of 2022, a 25.7% increase compared with the same period a year earlier, according to recently released central bank data.", "parent_comment": null, "article_title": "Egypt unearths mummification workshops, tombs in ancient burial ground", "article_url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypt-unearths-mummification-workshops-tombs-ancient-burial-ground-2023-05-27/", "platform": "reddit", "platform_id": "jltquwe", "composite_toxic": [[false, 35], [false, 95], [false, 91], [false, 69], [false, 210]]}

{"text": ">Technically, the Constitution Bench in the NCT case had left room open for changing the governance of Delhi. If Parliament were to pass a law, changing the governance of Delhi, and bringing all services under the control of the Union government, such a law might stand the test of legality, even if it were unwise. But by taking the ordinance route, the government has intentionally created a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\n>Admittedly, governments in the past have used the ordinance route to hand Parliament a fait accompli. But by taking that route, the government is cocking a snook at the Supreme Court. It is in effect saying: \u201cWe are using the purely technical possibility to negate everything you said about preserving the powers of an elected government in Delhi.\u201d\n\n>The Supreme Court will be damned if it does and damned if it does not. If it does not react to the use of this ordinance, it will send two signals. It will have failed to check the abuse of ordinance power of the Union government. There is no justification for bringing in an ordinance, when the government could have easily proposed legislation (however ill-advised it might be) in a few weeks\u2019 time. Second, it will have put its seal on the disenfranchisement of millions of Delhi citizens. This ordinance is, without saying it, following the precedent of what it did in\u00a0Jammu\u00a0and Kashmir: Change the legal status of a state without any accountability whatsoever. The silence of the Court and all other political parties on Kashmir is coming home to roost. Whatever one\u2019s views on Article 370, the unilateral downgrading of a state to a Union Territory should have occasioned judicial scrutiny and political opposition. \u201cFederalism for me, but not for thee\u201d is not a principle. The courts and the political system have conspired to produce this equilibrium.\n\n>On the other hand, if the Court strikes down the ordinance, you have a full-blown war between the executive and judiciary. The executive will claim the mandate of the popular national will to delegitimise the judiciary. It might be the case that the purpose of this ordinance is not to urgently wrest control of Delhi. It may be to engage in price discovery about how much the government can put judicial power in its place, and get away with it.
